# RetrievAIGen (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent)

What problem does it solve?
- Nowadays Large Language Models lack knowledge and context to generate contextually relevant responses. For example it doesn't know information about our company, recent news, etc. RAG is a system that solves that problem by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and then using that information to generate a response. I like to think of it as a human using books, watching news, reading PDF files or any other relevant data sources to search for information before responding to a question. 

What will be delivered?
- In case I want to implement, devlivered will be TECH NEWS bot that can answer questions about recent news. On high level it will be end-to-end application that will have a front-end where user can ask questions and a back-end that will use RAG to generate responses. And RAG will be built out of vector database, retriever (system of retrieving relevant information) and generator (system of generating response).

How it will be delivered?
- It will be delivered as Azure hosted application. With web based interface for user to ask questions and get responses. Using open-source Machine Learning models and libraries.
